Apache2 License¶
Apache2 协议¶

A large number of open source projects you find today are GPL Licensed.
现在你找到的许多开源项目都是以 GPL 协议发布的

While the GPL has its time and place, it should most certainly not be your go-to license for your next open source project.
虽然 GPL 有它自己的一席之地， 但在开始你的下一个开源项目时，GPL 应该不再是你的默认选择

A project that is released as GPL cannot be used in any commercial product without the product itself also being offered as open source.
项目发行于 GPL 协议之后，就不能用于任何本身没开源的商业产品中

The MIT, BSD, ISC, and Apache2 licenses are great alternatives to the GPL that allow your open-source software to be used freely in proprietary, closed-source software.
MIT、BSD、ISC、Apache2 许可都是优秀的替代品，它们允许你的开源软件自由应用在私有闭源软件中

Requests is released under terms of Apache2 License.
Requests 的发布许可为 Apache2 License.
