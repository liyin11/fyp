11.2. How not to fetch data over HTTP
11.2. 避免通过 HTTP 重复地获取数据

Let's say you want to download a resource over HTTP, such as a syndicated Atom feed.
假如说你想用 HTTP 下载资源，例如一个 Atom feed 汇聚

But you don't just want to download it once;
你不仅仅想下载一次

you want to download it over and over again, every hour, to get the latest news from the site that's offering the news feed.
而是想一次又一次地下载它，如每小时一次，从提供 news feed 的站点获得最新的消息

Let's do it the quick-and-dirty way first, and then see how you can do better.
让我们首先用一种直接而原始的方法来实现它，然后看看如何改进它

So what's wrong with this?
那么这种方法有何不妥之处吗

Well, for a quick one-off during testing or development, there's nothing wrong with it.
当然，在测试或开发中一次性的使用没有什么不妥

I do it all the time.
我经常这样

I wanted the contents of the feed, and I got the contents of the feed.
我想要 feed 汇聚的内容，我就获取 feed 的内容

The same technique works for any web page.
这种方法对其他 web 页面同样有效

But once you start thinking in terms of a web service that you want to access on a regular basis -- and remember, you said you were planning on retrieving this syndicated feed once an hour -- then you're being inefficient, and you're being rude.
但是一旦你开始按照 web 服务的方式去思考有规则的访问需求时 (记住，你说你计划每小时一次地重复获取这样的 feed ) 就会发现这样的做法效率实在是太低了，并且对服务器来说也太笨了

Let's talk about some of the basic features of HTTP.
下面先谈论一些 HTTP 的基本特性
