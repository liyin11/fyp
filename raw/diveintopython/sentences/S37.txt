6.2. Working with File Objects
6.2. 与文件对象共事

Python has a built-in function, open, for opening a file on disk.
Python 有一个内置函数，open，用来打开在磁盘上的文件

open returns a file object, which has methods and attributes for getting information about and manipulating the opened file.
open 返回一个文件对象，它拥有一些方法和属性，可以得到被打开文件的信息，以及对被打开文件进行操作

After you open a file, the first thing you'll want to do is read from it, as shown in the next example.
你打开文件之后，你要做的第一件事是从中读取，正如下一个例子所展示的

Open files consume system resources, and depending on the file mode, other programs may not be able to access them.
打开文件消耗系统资源，并且其间其它程序可能无法访问它们 (取决于文件模式)

It's important to close files as soon as you're finished with them.
这就是一旦操作完毕就该关闭文件的重要所在

Now you've seen enough to understand the file handling code in the fileinfo.py sample code from teh previous chapter.
现在你已经足能理解前一章的例子程序 fileinfo.py 的文件处理代码了

This example shows how to safely open and read from a file and gracefully handle errors.
下面这个例子展示了如何安全地打开文件和读取文件，以及优美地处理错误

As you would expect, you can also write to files in much the same way that you read from them.
正如你所期待的，你也能用与读取文件同样的方式写入文件

There are two basic file modes:
有两种基本的文件模式：

Either mode will create the file automatically if it doesn't already exist, so there's never a need for any sort of fiddly "if the log file doesn't exist yet, create a new empty file just so you can open it for the first time" logic.
如果文件还不存在，任意一种模式都将自动创建文件，因此从来不需要任何复杂的逻辑：“如果 log 文件还不存在，将创建一个新的空文件，正因为如此，你可以第一次就打开它”

Just open it and start writing.
打开文件并开始写就可以了
