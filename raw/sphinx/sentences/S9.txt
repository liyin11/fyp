That would give you the classic theme, but with a sidebar on the right side and a black background for the relation bar (the bar with the navigation links at the page’s top and bottom).
Sphinx supports changing the appearance of its HTML output via themes. A theme is a collection of HTML templates, stylesheet(s) and other static files. Additionally, it has a configuration file which specifies from which theme to inherit, which highlighting style to use, and what options exist for customizing the theme’s look and feel.

If the theme does not come with Sphinx, it can be in two static forms: either a directory (containing theme.conf and other needed files), or a zip file with the same contents.
Themes are meant to be project-unaware, so they can be used for different projects without change.

sphinxdoc
If the theme does not come with Sphinx, it can be in two forms: either a directory (containing theme.conf and other needed files), or a zip file with the same contents. Either of them must be put where Sphinx can find it; for this there is the config value html_theme_path. It gives a list of directories, relative to the directory containing conf.py, that can contain theme directories or zip files. For example, if you have a theme in the file blue.zip, you can put it right in the directory containing conf.py and use this configuration:
